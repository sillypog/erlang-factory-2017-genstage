<!-- Notes
There is a behavior called ConsumerSupervisor, which starts new consumers as demand comes in.
I didn't know about this when making the example. Don't know if it would be helpful in scaling the producer/consumer and consumer as a unit though. It starts a new child process per event as they come in; can definitely see how this might not always be the way to go.
