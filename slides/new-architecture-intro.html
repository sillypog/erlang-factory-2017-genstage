<h2>Pipeline Requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Handle 100M events / day</li>
  <li>Separate capture, processing, and retrieval</li>
  <li>Data retrieval should not affect data capture</li>
  <li>Events should be stored in their original format</li>
  <li>Data should be accessible via SQL interface</li>
</ul>

<!-- This should be a list of the features we want in the pipeline, not
  the implementation. The implementation is clear from the architecture diagram on the next slide, so I end up saying things twice. Take some of the "flaws" from previous slides and turn them into requirements here. -->
